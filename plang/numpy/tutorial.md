# Numpy tutorial

## The basics
In NumPy dimensions are called axes. The number of axes is rank.
For example, the coordinates of a point in 3D space [1, 2, 1] is an array of rank 1, because it has one axis. That axis has a length of 3. In the example pictured below, the array has rank 2 (it is 2-dimensional). The first dimension (axis) has a length of 2, the second dimension has a length of 3.
```
[[ 1., 0., 0.],
 [ 0., 1., 2.]]
```

## Array Creation
There are several ways to create arrays.

``numpy.array`` creates array with python iterable object.
```
import numpy as np
np.array( [ i for i in range(10)])  # Use python list
np.array( (1,2,3))  # Use python tuple
np.array( set([1,2,3])) # Use python set
np.array([(1.5,2,3), (4,5,6)]) # create two-dimensional array
```

``numpy.zeros`` creates an array full of zeros, while ``numpy.ones`` creates an array full of ones. And ``numpy.empty`` creates an array whose initial content is random and depends on the state of the memory. By default, the dtype of the created array is `float64`.
```
import numpy as np
np.zeros( (3,4))  # create an array with shape (3,4)
np.empty( (3,4))
```
``numpy.arange(start, stop, step)`` will create sequences of numbers.
``numpy.lnspace(start, stop, total_elements)`` will create  sequences of numbers too.
```
import numpy as np
np.arange(10,30,5)  # array([10, 15, 20, 25])
np.linspace(0,2,9)  # array([ 0.  , 0.25, 0.5, ... , 1.75, 2])
```
## Basic Operations
Arithmetic operators on arrays apply elementwise. 
```
>>> A = np.array( [[1,1],
...             [0,1]] )
>>> B = np.array( [[2,0],
...             [3,4]] )
>>> A*B                         # elementwise product
array([[2, 0],
       [0, 4]])
>>> A.dot(B)                    # matrix product
array([[5, 4],
       [3, 4]])
>>> np.dot(A, B)                # another matrix product
array([[5, 4],
       [3, 4]])                 # [ [ A[0,:] * B[:,0], A[0,:] * B[:,1] ],
                                #   [ A[1,:] * B[:,0], A[1,:] * B[:,1] ]
```

## Universal Functions
NumPy provides familiar mathematical functions such as sin, cos, and exp. In NumPy, these are called “universal functions”(ufunc). Within NumPy, these functions operate elementwise on an array, producing an array as output.

## Indexing, Slicing and Iterating
``One-dimentional`` arrays can be indexed, sliced and iterated over, much like lists and other Python sequences.
