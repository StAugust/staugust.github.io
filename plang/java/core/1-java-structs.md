# block
Lines between the braces {} are called a block.
Since whitespace is irrelevant to the Java compiler, there're many brace styles, one can use any style as he likes. 

# Comment
Comments do not show up in the executable program. 
Java has three ways of marking comments. 
1. use **//**
```
System.out.println("Hello world!"); // comment here
```
2. use **/\*** and **\*/**
```
/\*\*
 *
 */
```
